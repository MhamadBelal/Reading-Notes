## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?
I bring a unique combination of skills, experiences, and qualities that sets me apart from others. My expertise in web Development combined with my [soft skills such as strong communication and problem-solving abilities] gives me a distinct advantage. Additionally, my [specific experiences or projects] have provided me with a unique perspective and approach to problem-solving, which I believe can bring valuable contributions to my career and potential employers.

## What are 3 things I’ll start doing to "un-stick" myself whenever I get stuck on a tough piece of code, logic, or feature?
a. I will actively seek help and collaborate with others. By reaching out to peers, mentors, or online communities, I can tap into different perspectives and insights that can help me overcome obstacles. Collaboration can lead to new ideas and approaches that I may not have considered on my own.

b. I will break down the problem into smaller parts. When faced with a complex challenge, I will analyze the problem and identify its components. By addressing each smaller part individually, I can gain a better understanding of the problem and work towards a comprehensive solution step by step.

c. I will conduct thorough research and explore available resources. In order to un-stick myself, I will take the time to delve into relevant documentation, technical articles, tutorials, and online courses. By expanding my knowledge and exploring alternative approaches, I can find inspiration and solutions to overcome the specific obstacle I am facing.
