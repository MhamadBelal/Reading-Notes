# Exception Handling

## why this topic matters as it relates to what you are studying in this module?

Exception handling is a crucial aspect of software development, ensuring reliability and user satisfaction. By studying this topic, you will learn to anticipate and manage errors effectively, maintaining system stability and enhancing the user experience. Mastering exception handling equips you to develop robust and fault-tolerant software solutions, contributing to project quality and meeting user expectations.

1. Name one major benefit of being able to trace the call stack.

    Answer: Tracing the call stack is like following a breadcrumb trail that leads developers straight to the heart of software issues. It unveils a detailed map of function calls, revealing the exact path that led to errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior. Armed with this treasure trove of information, developers can dissect variables, parameters, and intermediate results at each step, ultimately unearthing the elusive root cause of the problem. It's like shining a spotlight on the dark corners of code, illuminating the precise location where bugs hide, and enabling developers to swiftly exterminate them.


2. If you could use try/catch in your day to day life, name an exception you’d like to ‘catch’ and handle.

    answer: If I plan a vacation with my boyfriend and then he apologizes, I have to stay calm and make another plan for myself to go somewhere that works for me.



3. From an efficiency standpoint, are there downsides to try/catch blocks?

    answer: From an efficiency standpoint, try/catch blocks can introduce performance overhead and make code less readable, but they are necessary for handling exceptions and ensuring robustness in software.



4. Describe how you explain the .Net approach to exception handling to a non technical friend.

    answer: it is like you want to do something and you dout that it may be an error, so you put another plan if the error happens, so you change all the plan and perform another thing given the current circumstance.





Therac-25:

Insufficient hardware interlocks and inadequate software design led to high radiation doses being delivered to patients.
Poor error messages made it difficult for operators to diagnose and address potential issues.
Ariane 5:

Incompatible software reuse from Ariane 4 caused critical failure during the maiden flight.
Insufficient error handling and lack of thorough testing resulted in a self-destruction event due to an unexpected exception.
