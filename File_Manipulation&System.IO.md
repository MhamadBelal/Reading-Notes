# File Manipulation / System.IO

## why this topic matters

File Manipulation/System.IO is an essential topic in software development that directly relates to the current module. It is important because it enables data persistence, data integration from various file formats, configuration management, logging and debugging, data transformation, and file system interaction. Understanding this topic equips developers with the skills necessary to handle files, manage data, and perform input/output operations effectively in software applications.

## summary

File and Stream I/O in .NET involves reading from and writing to files and data streams. The System.IO namespace provides classes for working with files, directories, streams, readers, writers, compression, and more. File-related classes allow operations like creating, copying, moving, and deleting files and directories. Streams enable reading and writing bytes, while readers and writers handle character-based I/O. Asynchronous I/O operations help maintain application responsiveness. Compression classes support compressing and decompressing files and streams. Isolated storage provides a secure way to store application-specific data. It's important to consider security requirements and differences when developing Windows Store apps. Overall, understanding File and Stream I/O is essential for efficient data management in .NET development.


The second article provides a comprehensive overview of different methods for writing text to a file in a .NET application. It covers the usage of classes such as StreamWriter, File, and Path. The StreamWriter class enables synchronous and asynchronous writing, while the File class offers methods for writing and appending text. The Path class assists in constructing file or directory paths. The article includes code examples demonstrating how to write text synchronously, append text, write asynchronously, and use the File class for writing and appending. It emphasizes the importance of error checking and exception handling in real-world applications. Overall, it serves as a valuable resource for developers looking to implement file writing functionality in their .NET apps.


The third article demonstrates how to create a new data file, write data to it using the BinaryWriter class, and read the data back using the BinaryReader class. The example provided creates a file stream called "Test.data" in the current directory. It uses a BinaryWriter object to write integers from 0 to 10 to the file, and then a BinaryReader object to read and display the contents of the file. The article also mentions that if the file already exists, an IOException exception is thrown, and suggests using FileMode.Create instead of FileMode.CreateNew to always create a new file without exceptions. The code example showcases the usage of FileStream, BinaryWriter, and BinaryReader to accomplish the file reading and writing tasks.
