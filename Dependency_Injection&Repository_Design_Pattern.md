# Dependency Injection & Repository Design Pattern

## why this topic matters 


Dependency Injection and the Repository Design Pattern are essential concepts in software development. They enable the separation of concerns, making code modular and easy to maintain. These patterns enhance testability, flexibility, and code reusability. By adhering to them, developers can achieve scalable and maintainable applications while aligning with industry standards.

## Summary


Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that focuses on decoupling components in software development. Instead of having a class create its dependencies, DI involves injecting those dependencies into the class from the outside. By doing so, the code becomes more modular, testable, and maintainable. DI promotes loose coupling, allowing developers to replace or modify dependencies without altering the core code.

The Repository Pattern is another essential concept that aims to separate data access logic from the rest of the application. It acts as an abstraction layer between the application and data storage, providing a consistent interface for data operations. This pattern improves code reusability, testability, and flexibility in choosing different data storage implementations.

The term "Repository Design Pattern" is often used interchangeably with the "Repository Pattern," representing the same concept mentioned above, serving as a bridge between the application and data storage.

The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in object-oriented programming:

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one responsibility, ensuring that changes to one aspect do not affect others.

2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification, allowing new features to be added without altering existing code.

3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without causing issues or unexpected behavior.

4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use, favoring multiple smaller interfaces over a single large one.

5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.

Adhering to the SOLID principles brings several benefits, such as improved code quality, easy maintenance, reduced coupling, and greater extensibility. By following these principles, developers create more robust and scalable software, making it easier for teams to collaborate and introduce changes without introducing unintended side effects. The SOLID principles also help align code with industry best practices, ensuring the codebase is maintainable and understandable for developers, even as the project evolves over time.
