# Reading-Notes
This site is designed to help me keep track of my observations and questions from the reading assignments throughout my course. It provides a convenient platform where I can organize and store my thoughts in one place. With this site, I can easily refer back to my notes and reflections whenever I need them, ensuring that I effectively manage my learning process. It's a valuable tool that allows me to stay organized and have a record of my insights and inquiries for future reference.
