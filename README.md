## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

### SQL Practice
Throughout the lessons on relational databases and SQL, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of key concepts and techniques. I started with an introduction to SQL and learned about the fundamentals of SELECT queries, including filtering and sorting query results. The lessons on queries with constraints deepened my knowledge by exploring various conditions and logical operators to retrieve specific data. Multi-table queries with JOINs enabled me to work with multiple tables simultaneously, combining related data as needed.

I also learned about data manipulation, including inserting new rows into tables, updating existing data, and deleting specific rows when necessary. Understanding how to create tables and modify their structure using the ALTER TABLE statement expanded my skills in managing the database schema. Finally, I explored the process of dropping tables, effectively removing them from the database.

By covering these topics, I have developed a solid foundation in SQL and relational databases. This knowledge will empower me to work efficiently with data, retrieve specific information, manipulate tables, and perform various database operations. As I continue to explore and practice SQL, I will be equipped with the necessary skills to work effectively with relational databases in real-world scenarios.

### Practice in the Terminal

During my journey of exploring the command line interface, I have acquired valuable knowledge and skills. Here's a summary of what I've learned:

1. Command Line Basics: I have gained an understanding of the command line interface and its advantages for interacting with computer systems. It provides me with greater control and efficiency compared to graphical user interfaces.

2. File System Navigation: Navigating through the file system has become familiar to me. I now know how to determine my current working directory, list the contents of a directory, and change directories to navigate to different locations.

3. File and Directory Management: I have learned about various file and directory management tasks. This includes creating directories to organize my files, removing directories when they are no longer needed, creating blank files, copying files or directories to duplicate them, moving files or directories to different locations (including renaming them), and removing files.

4. Understanding File Types: I now have knowledge of how to obtain information about the type of a file or directory. This allows me to identify different file types and understand their characteristics.

5. Accessing Manual Pages: I have discovered the power of manual pages as a valuable resource for obtaining detailed information about commands. I can search for manual pages using keywords and navigate through them to gain a deeper understanding of specific commands.

Through these learnings, I have expanded my command line proficiency and acquired the skills to navigate the file system, manage files and directories, understand file types, and leverage the vast knowledge available in manual pages. These skills will serve as a solid foundation for my continued exploration and utilization of the command line interface.
