# Unit Testing and Documentation

## why this topic matters?

Studying unit testing and documentation in this module is essential for software development. Unit testing ensures software quality by identifying bugs and verifying expected behavior, leading to more robust code. Documentation promotes collaboration, providing clear guidelines and explanations of code functionality, enhancing productivity and facilitating maintenance. Acquiring these skills empowers students to contribute effectively to building successful software systems.

## Name 3 ways in which Unit Testing improves your codebase and productivity?

1. Catching Bugs Early.

2. Improving Code Quality.

3. Encouraging Refactoring and Modularity.

## How would you write a unit test for a household task such as putting away laundry?

1. Arrange, Act, Assert: Structuring tests with clear arrangements, actions, and assertions.
2. Use relevant and high-quality test data: Test with data that is similar to what the application will handle in the production environment.
3. One assert per test method: Aim for one assertion per test method to improve test clarity and maintainability.
4. Avoid test interdependence: Ensure that each test is independent and doesn't rely on the state or order of execution of other tests.
5. Write tests before code: Practice Test Driven Development (TDD) by creating test cases before writing the actual code.
6. Keep tests short, sweet, and visible: Avoid excessive abstraction and keep test setup logic easily understandable.
7. Use headless testing when appropriate: Use headless testing frameworks when testing user interfaces is not necessary.
