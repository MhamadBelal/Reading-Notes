**EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE SELF:**

After completing the Emotional Intelligence Self-Assessment Tool, I have obtained scores for each category. My scores are as follows:

Self-Awareness: Total 21
Self-Management: Total 19
Social Awareness: Total 16
Relationship Management: Total 23

By interpreting the scores, I can identify areas where I can improve my emotional intelligence. Any component with a score below 18 indicates an area that requires attention and development. It is important to remember that emotional intelligence is a learnable and developmental skill. I can seek feedback from others, engage in mentoring, and explore resources such as books and seminars to enhance my emotional intelligence in those areas.

This assessment has provided me with insights into my current level of emotional intelligence. It highlights areas where I may need to focus my efforts in order to enhance my self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management skills. Improving emotional intelligence can positively impact my interactions and relationships with others, both personally and professionally.






**Bias Self-Assessment:**

Based on the Bias Self-Assessment, I scored a total of 95, indicating that I have made some progress in understanding and addressing bias, but there is still room for growth. One area I will focus on in the coming weeks is "Connect to Mitigate Bias," as it scored relatively lower compared to other sections. This suggests that I need to actively seek support and input from others to challenge and overcome my own biases and assumptions. Additionally, I will continue to work on "Meaningful Connections" and "Empathy and Curiosity" to enhance my ability to understand and empathize with different perspectives. The assessment has highlighted the importance of ongoing self-reflection and learning to create a more inclusive and unbiased environment.
