# Intro to MVC

## why this topic matters?

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a fundamental concept in software development, particularly in creating organized and scalable applications. It involves dividing an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. The Model handles data and logic, the View manages user interface presentation, and the Controller coordinates interactions between the Model and View. This separation of concerns promotes modularity, reusability, and easier collaboration within development teams. MVC's impact is far-reaching, enhancing user experiences, aiding in maintenance, and enabling adaptability across diverse platforms. Understanding MVC is pivotal for creating effective and well-structured software systems.

## Summary

Azure DevOps is a comprehensive set of development tools and services offered by Microsoft, designed to assist software teams in planning, developing, testing, delivering, and monitoring applications. It encompasses features like version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), issue tracking, and more. Azure DevOps streamlines collaboration among developers, testers, and operations teams, facilitating the end-to-end software development lifecycle.

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for designing web applications. It divides an application into three components: Model (data and logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates Model and View). This separation enhances code organization, reusability, and collaboration among developers. MVC is foundational in creating well-structured and maintainable web applications.

Tag Helpers are a feature in ASP.NET Core MVC that simplify generating HTML elements within Razor views. They allow developers to create dynamic HTML elements with server-side logic, reducing the need for complex and error-prone syntax. Tag Helpers improve code readability and maintainability by encapsulating HTML generation within server-side code, enhancing the development experience and promoting consistency in view design.

Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework that simplifies web design and development. It provides pre-designed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components, such as grids, forms, buttons, and navigation bars, which can be easily customized to create responsive and visually appealing websites and web applications. Bootstrap's framework accelerates development by offering a consistent and mobile-friendly foundation for building modern user interfaces.
